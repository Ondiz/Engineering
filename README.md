# Engineering
Some engineering code to try and watch curious phenomena! (In Spanish by now but in the way to traslation)

## Folders 

### Proyecto 
Here you can find my Masters Thesis and its corresponding code. It was about  multiaxial fatigue --  I compared some methods for life prediction. I learned Matlab programming while writing this code, so it's messy. Sorry about that.

### modosTemperatura
I studied the effect of varying Young modulus in the mode shapes of a beam (both axial and bending)

### ModosComplejos
There you can find some code for trying to understand the effect of complex modes in noise radiation.
